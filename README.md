Repository for public branch of open source NSF logistic Model

This model is for discussion and exploration purposes only. The tool depicted here should not be considered a complete product, nor is it ready for deployment. However, this code can serve as an important starting point for analyzing the single audit reports available from the FAC database to apply to your own improper payments model or other compliance use cases. We recommend that you enhance this model with additional data sets that are most relevant to your organization or desired use case, and tailor it accordingly. This code is not intended for standalone use.
